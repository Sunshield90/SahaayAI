SahaayAI: Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness

Project Overview
SahaayAI is a web-based prototype for a confidential, empathetic, AI-powered companion designed to support youth mental wellness in India. It provides a safe, anonymous, and stigma-free space for young people to discuss their feelings, particularly stresses related to academic pressure, social anxiety, and other challenges. The platform aims to be a supportive first step for those who may hesitate to seek traditional mental health care due to cost, accessibility, or social stigma.
The application is a single-page website that introduces the concept and includes a fully functional chatbot powered by Google's Gemini AI.

Features
- Modern, Responsive Website: A single-page landing page that is friendly, calming, and inviting for young users.
- Anonymous Chat: Users can interact with the AI without creating an account or providing personal information.
- Empathetic AI Companion: The chatbot is programmed to be a warm, supportive listener, fluent in English, Hindi, and Hinglish.
- Crisis Detection: A built-in safety feature that detects keywords related to self-harm and immediately provides 24/7 crisis helpline numbers in India.
- Culturally Aware: The language and persona are tailored to be relatable to youth in India.

How the Project Works
- The user experience is designed to be simple, safe, and immediate.
- Landing Page: The user arrives on the single-page website which explains the project's mission, the problems it addresses, and its features.
- Initiating a Chat: The user clicks a "Try the Prototype" button, which opens a chat widget on the same screen.
- Activation (First-time use on a local machine): The chatbot prompts the user for a Google Gemini API key to activate the AI. This key is stored temporarily in the browser for the session and is not shared.
- Anonymous Conversation: Once activated, the user can immediately start chatting with SahaayAI. The conversation is entirely anonymous.
- AI Interaction: SahaayAI listens to the user, validates their feelings, and offers supportive conversation. If the AI detects keywords indicating a crisis, it automatically provides helpline numbers, prioritizing user safety.

Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- AI Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Platform: Google Cloud (specifically Vertex AI for generative conversations)
- Icons: Font Awesome
- Fonts: Google Fonts (Poppins)

How to Run the Prototype Locally
1. The entire project is self-contained in a single HTML file (sahaayai.html). 
2. Save the File: Make sure you have the complete code saved in a file named sahaayai.html. 
3. Open in Browser: Open the sahaayai.html file directly in any modern web browser (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge). 
4. Activate the Chatbot: Click on any "Try Prototype" button to open the chat widget.
The chatbot will ask for a Google Gemini API key. This is required because the AI model runs on Google's servers, and the key authenticates your requests.
5. Getting Your API Key:
- Go to Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/
- Sign in with your Google account.
- Click on "Get API key" and then "Create API key in new project."
- Copy the generated key.
- Start Chatting:
- Paste the copied API key into the chat input field and press Enter.
- The chatbot will be activated for your browser session, and you can start your conversation.
